changing owner address because of no check

The problem with the contract is that there arent any checks for the owner. There is only one function so again we have to create another contract on remix ide and connect it to the original one.
We create a new function called changeowner to do just that and we create a variable to store the original contract in and then within our function we call that object along with the changeowner command of solidity and our wallet address inside the paranthesis
